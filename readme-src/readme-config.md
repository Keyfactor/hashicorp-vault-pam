### Configuring for PAM Usage
#### In Hashicorp Vault
When configuring the Hashicorp Vault for use as a PAM Provider with Keyfactor, you will need to set up and configure the `kv` functionality in Vault. You will need an API Key that has the right permissions. The default `secret` location can be used, or another location.

After adding a secret object to `kv` with a key and value, you can use the object's name (the "KV Secret Name") and the secret's key (the "KV Secret Key") to retrieve credentials from the Hashicorp Vault as a PAM Provider.

#### On Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator
##### Installation
Configuring the UO to use the Hashicorp Vault PAM Provider requries first installing it as an extension by copying the release contents into a new extension folder named `Hashicorp-Vault`.
A `manifest.json` file is included in the release. This file needs to be edited to enter in the "initialization" parameters for the PAM Provider. Specifically values need to be entered for the parameters in the `manifest.json` of the __PAM Provider extension__:

~~~ json
"Keyfactor:PAMProviders:Hashicorp-Vault:InitializationInfo": {
    "Host": "http://127.0.0.1:8200",
    "Path": "v1/secret/data",
    "Token": "xxxxxx"
  }
~~~

##### Usage
To use the PAM Provider to resolve a field, for example a Server Password, instead of entering in the actual value for the Server Password, enter a `json` object with the parameters specifying the field.
The parameters needed are the "instance" parameters above:

~~~ json
{"Secret":"my-kv-secret","Key":"myServerPassword"}
~~~

If a field supports PAM but should not use PAM, simply enter in the actual value to be used instead of the `json` format object above.
